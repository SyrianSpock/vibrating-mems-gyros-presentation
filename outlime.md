# Introduction

# Physical concept

# Implementation

Most common realization uses stable quartz resonator with piezoelectric driver circuits

# Limits


# Advantages
Can be made to resist very high accelerations (~ 10'000 g)

# Drawbacks
High drift rates
Resonator time constants
Sensitivity to environment effects, particularly temperature changes and vibratory motion

# Performances

Bias ~ 0.1 to 1 deg / second
Drift with temparature ~ 0.01 to 0.05 % / degC
Bandwidth 60 to 500 Hz
Shock resistance > 20'000 g

Size is in the cm range (2x2x2 cm^3 or smaller)

# Applications

Used particularly to provide feedback for stabilisation or angular position measurement tasks
